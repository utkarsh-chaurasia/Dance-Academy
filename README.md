# Dance-Academy

As a web developer, I had the opportunity to work on a paid project for a dance academy in the USA. I designed and developed a website for the academy using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, showcasing my skills in web development.

The website features a modern and user-friendly interface, with easy navigation and responsive design for seamless viewing on different devices. It includes an event calendar, a list of classes offered, and a section for the academy's instructors and their bios. I also integrated a payment gateway to enable online payments for the academy's classes.

Throughout the project, I worked closely with the client, ensuring that their vision was incorporated into the design and functionality of the website. I maintained regular communication with the client to address their feedback and make any necessary changes.

I am proud to have developed this website for the dance academy and believe it is a valuable addition to my resume. The project demonstrates my ability to work with clients to develop a product that meets their needs and specifications, my expertise in web development, and my attention to detail and dedication to delivering high-quality work.
